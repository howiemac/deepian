see flat file publishing code in Page.py in this folder...

this following code was inserted in base/serve/dispatch.py  at line 55: 

    # special case for serving up flat files ---- INCOMPLETE - depend
    if config.flat_files and req.user.is_guest() and uri_type=="obj" and cls=="" and method=="":
      return self.doFlatfile(req, '%s/site/data/???/???/%s' % (self.htdocs_path(req), uri))

- really should be inserted at line 57, after default class is set (and looking for cls=="Page"), as flat-files is page specific

- not completed - as tricky to get at the necessary base/Page/File.py line 67 File_folder() function
- and makes UNSAFE assumptions that default_class is Page (which is not the case for Base, only for my apps)
- problems is I can't override base/serve/dispatch.py at app level... (Can I??)

see also evoke/deepian/code/config.py for default_class and <proposed> flat_files Config settings
- and base/Page/config.py for <proposed> flat_files Config setting

 really the flat file serving needs its own one-purpose small stand alone server app, serving up only flat files
